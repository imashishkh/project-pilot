# MacAgent Fixes and Enhancements

This document summarizes the key fixes and enhancements made to resolve issues in the MacAgent system.

## 1. Fixed Parameter Mismatch in Action Handlers

The most critical issue was a parameter mismatch between the planning module and the action module:

- Modified `press_key` method in `action.py` to accept a `key_combination` parameter
- Added logic to handle either direct key+modifiers parameters or the key_combination parameter
- Ensured backward compatibility with existing code

## 2. Enhanced Natural Language Understanding

Integrated the intelligence module with the planning module for better natural language instruction processing:

- Connected `InstructionProcessor` from intelligence module to the planning module
- Added fallback to basic rule-based parsing if advanced NLP isn't available
- Created a helper method to convert parsed instructions to executable actions

## 3. Added API Key Configuration

Created a configuration system for API keys to enable advanced language processing:

- Added `config/api_keys.json` for storing OpenAI and Anthropic API keys
- Implemented dynamic loading of API keys in the planning module
- Added graceful fallback when API keys aren't available

## How to Use Advanced Language Understanding

1. Add your API keys to `config/api_keys.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "openai_api_key": "your-openai-api-key",
     "anthropic_api_key": "your-anthropic-api-key"
   }
   ```

2. Run MacAgent with the default command:
   ```bash
   python -m MacAgent.main
   ```

The system will automatically:
- Try to use the advanced language processing if API keys are available
- Fall back to basic rule-based parsing if they're not

## Command Examples

With these improvements, MacAgent can now handle more complex instructions like:

- "Open Finder and navigate to the Downloads folder"
- "Take a screenshot and save it to the Desktop"
- "Open Safari, go to google.com, and search for Python programming tutorials"

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify that API keys are correctly configured if you want to use advanced language understanding
3. Try using more specific commands if the agent doesn't understand complex instructions

The system is now more robust and can handle parameter mismatches gracefully while providing improved natural language understanding capabilities.
